# CSE-111(Databases)
This repository contains all the labs/files I utilized throughout my time in CSE 111, or Databases, at the University of California, Merced. We worked heavily with SQLite. I came into this class without working on SQL before, although I caught on quick. By about lab 4 I could tell I was getting the hang of it and the queries came a lot easier to me. Notes to this class can be found digitally on my Notion, on a request basis. This repository may not be utilized down the line without proper credit to the author (**David Dominguez** for SQL queries usually found in 'test' folder, **Florin Ruso** for anything else) whether that be specific lines of code or ideas.

## Lab 1 
- Building tables

## Lab 2 
- Populating tables

## Lab 3 
- If I navigate to a certain element on a table, I can access anything within that tuple

## Lab 4
- If you need to group multiple columns, the correct syntax is GROUP BY column_1, column_2
