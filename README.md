# CSE-111(Databases)
This repository contains all the labs/files I utilized throughout my time in CSE 111, or Databases, at the University of California, Merced. We worked heavily with SQLite. I came into this class without working on SQL before, although I caught on quick. By about lab 4 I could tell I was getting the hang of it and the queries came a lot easier to me. Notes to this class can be found digitally on my Notion, on a request basis. This repository may not be utilized down the line without proper credit to the author (**David Dominguez** for SQL queries usually found in 'test' folder, **Florin Ruso** for anything else) whether that be specific lines of code or ideas.

## Lab 1 
- Building tables

## Lab 2 
- Populating tables

## Lab 3 
- If I navigate to a certain element on a table, I can access anything within that tuple

## Lab 4
- If you need to group multiple columns, the correct syntax is GROUP BY column_1, column_2

## Quiz 2 
- The trees are cool. Definitely a breeze once you figure out what the SQL equivalent statements are. 
- I was stuck on #3 for a long time. Thanks to Jackie for helping me with that one, I was able to intersect the makers correctly, I just didn't join the models with one another to gain that correlation. Good to know for next time though. 

## Lab 5
- I found that if you include tables that serve no purpose in the query, then your query may run EXTRAORDINARILY SLOW. Wow what a difference after I went through and optimized some of the queries.
- Note from problem 9: group by and order by are so confusing to work with together, but this problem _sorta_ makes sense. 
- Note from problem 7: collaboration with Salvador Rodriguez, who helped me solve why I was getting an unnecessary amount in the count. Turns out if you include unnecessary tables in the FROM clause you might have different results. See the problem for more info.
- Note from problem 5: collaboration with Salvador Rodriguez, we both realized our outputs are the same, however we were failing the test case, because lines 3 & 4 are swapped in the result file the test file is checking with. Will include this in comments for submission to get 12/15

## Lab 6
- Okay definitely did not have enough time to do this, wasn't time inefficiency just unfortunate turn of events for the week
- Although, did play a lot with subqueries in the GROUP BY - HAVING clause, along with in the SELECT clause as well. 
- Will go to TA for the following lab to see if I can further improve this lab past the due date and do better for next lab.
