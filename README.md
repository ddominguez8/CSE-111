# CSE-111(Databases)
This repository contains all the labs/files I utilized throughout my time in CSE 111, or Databases, at the University of California, Merced. We worked heavily with SQLite. I came into this class without working on SQL before, although I caught on quick. By about lab 4 I could tell I was getting the hang of it and the queries came a lot easier to me. Notes to this class can be found digitally on my Notion, on a request basis. This repository may not be utilized down the line without proper credit to the author (**David Dominguez** for SQL queries usually found in 'test' folder, **Florin Ruso** for anything else) whether that be specific lines of code or ideas.
